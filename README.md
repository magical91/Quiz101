# Quiz101

This project contains my Quiz101 application. This project was build from scratch for our even number week. In this project you will find a set of questions pertaining to JavaScript. Each question will be worth 20 points. Also, this quiz will be timed with a timer of 30 seconds. Futhermore, at the end of the questions you will be asked to enter your name for a chance to be in the top 5 scores.
